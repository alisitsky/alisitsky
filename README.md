### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Artyom, I'm a QA Engineer since 2014.

Currently I'm working on a [pet project](https://github.com/alisitsky/steam_tests) of test automation in Java for WEB and API apps.

And I'm open to work btw ;) Here is my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G9SkotmPHYa7YW_u7hLk2FPU3PXqqY6y5eOIN7ZgWWw/edit)
